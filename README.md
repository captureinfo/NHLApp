# About NHLApp

NHLApp provides information about National Historical Landmarks, both with a tableview and a mapview. When clicked on the pins on the mapview, or an item in the tableview,
the Wikipedia page for the place will show up. Network connection is required for information update.

Currently, NHLApp only has information for New York City. Support for more features and more regions are in the works. We can add data without you updating you app!

NHLApp is built on top of Google Places API and Firebase.
